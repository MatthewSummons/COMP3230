# COMP3230

Operating Systems (CS) Fall 2023-2024 HKU. I wrote my own shell in C and used multithreading to speed up an LLM text generator.

We learnt basic OS topics including proceses, memory, persistence and concurrency. You can check out the course content on HKU's website. You can find the official code for the course [here](https://github.com/aiot-lab/HKU-COMP3230A-Tutorialabs).

We used the free online textbook, [Operating Systems:  Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/). Great book, gives a detailed overview of the fundamentals of operating systems with great sources and witty, snarky comments sprinkled here and there.
